//Explain what the following code does: ((n & (n-1)) == 0)
	
/* It examines whether n is power of 2 except 0. If n is power of 2, n & (n - 1) equals 0.
 * Because if n is power of 2, the binary representation will have only one 1 bit and the other bits
 * remains 0. And it minus 1, it will get all 1s through the 1 in n.
